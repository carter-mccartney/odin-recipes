		<h2>Steps</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Cook the sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium heat in a large saucepan until well browned.</li>
			<li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, and water. Season with pepper. Cover it and simmer for about 1.5 hrs, stirring occasionally.</li>
			<li>In another pan, bring water to a boil. We are cooking the lasagna noodles in this, so make sure there is enough water. Add the lasagna noodles and salt into the water and boil for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain the noodles and rinse them with cold water.</li>
